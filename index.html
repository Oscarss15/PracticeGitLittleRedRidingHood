                    <p id="textstory1">Once upon a time there lived a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother had a little red riding hood made for her. Everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.
                        One day her mother said to her: “Go my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill.”</p>

                    <p id="textstory2">Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately.
                    As she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf. He asked her where she was going.                          
                    “I am going to see my grandmother.”                            
                    “Does she live far off?” said the wolf.       
                    “It is beyond that mill you see there”.                          
                    It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman’s house.</p>
